  * Create a `Flash` class (this may not seem very DRY).
  * You can just add a second cookie for the flash.

    * Define these on a `UrlHelper` module
    * have them optionally take a parameter (`post_url(@post)`)
* `link_to`, `button_to` helpers
* Add a way for the user to define his/her own helpers
* Add partial
    * Start with `render :partial => "xyz", :locals => { ... }`
