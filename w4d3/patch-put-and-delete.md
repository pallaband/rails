# PATCH, PUT and DELETE

By default web browsers can only issue POST and GET requests:

```html
<form action="/users" method="POST"></form>

<!-- or -->

<form action="/users/search" method="GET"></form>

<!-- not -->
<form action="/users/123" method="PATCH"></form> <!-- won't work! -->
```

But wait... Doesn't the Rails REST API expose endpoints for PATCH,
PUT, and DELETE methods (verbs)? how do we write a form that sends a
PATCH, PUT, or DELETE?

Rails has baked in the following hack:

```html
<form action="/users/123" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PATCH">
</form>
```

In any form where a PATCH, PUT, or DELETE is the desired method,
simply put a hidden input field with name `_method` and value
`PATCH`/`PUT`/`DELETE`. The browser will still issue a POST request,
but Rails will see the `_method` parameter and pretend as if a
PUT/DELETE was made.


# PATCH vs. PUT

**Just use PATCH**.

In the HTTP standard, the `PUT` method is meant for sending a complete
resource to overwrite the existing version of that resource on the
server. A `PATCH` request is meant for when you only send the updated
attributes of the resource to the server.

Before Rails 4.0, the update action responded only to a `PUT` request.
The use of `PATCH` is more accurate, because with Rails we usually
just send the updated attributes to the server, and not a complete
copy of the resource we are updating.

For the moment, the update method will be called for either a `PUT` or
a `PATCH` request to the Rails server with the appropriate route.
Prefer using `PATCH`.

`PUT` vs `PATCH` is one of the meaningless ideological debates that
the internet loves to discuss. Just keep it simple and use
`PATCH`. :-)
